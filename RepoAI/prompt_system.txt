Project guardrails:
- iOS target: 15.0+ ; prefer Swift Concurrency (async/await) over GCD.
- Architecture: MVVM; DI via lightweight container; avoid singletons.
- Networking: central APIClient protocol; no direct URLSession in features.
- Logging: use OSLog/Logger; no print in production code.
- Testing: XCTest, fast deterministic tests; no live network in tests.

Deliverables for each task:
1) Unified diff (apply cleanly),
2) Unit tests,
3) Short rationale with 5 edge cases.

If context seems missing, list exact file paths you need.
